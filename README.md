# ðŸª™ Real-Time Cryptocurrency Data Ingestion Pipeline

This project is a **real-time data engineering pipeline** that scrapes live cryptocurrency data from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com) using **Selenium**, and stores the cleaned data in both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** databases. The system is designed to run continuously in the background using `nohup`, enabling seamless, long-running ingestion of dynamic web data.
